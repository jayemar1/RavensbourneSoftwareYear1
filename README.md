CSV file contents: Data from 200 cars travelling at different speeds.

How the code works:
The code when run, opens up the data file and reads it. It then loops through each line of the data and the counter groups together reoccuring speeds recorded by the cars. The 10 most common speeds travelled at is recorded as well as the number of cars travelling at those speeds. That data is then plotted on a bar graph that clearly shows the speeds in miles per hour and the number of cars which travelled at those 10 speeds.

Data Analysis:
The data is then re-read and provides a varied analysis of the entire data file of 200 bits of data, not just the top 10 as with the graph, which is displyed in sentence format in the console. 

Potential future updates:
I would perhaps change the code to plot more than one graph to help improve the visualisation aspect of the data.
